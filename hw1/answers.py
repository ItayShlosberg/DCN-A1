part2_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**

More neighbors smooths out local weirdness, which is what causes lack of generalization.
The more smoothing, the less local "hiccups" in the model, and the more generalization.

And,if we choose K = data set size, then our algorithm behaves as
underfitting and it gives a smooth decision surface and everything
becomes one class which is the majority class in our DataSet.

So, we should choose K wisely such that it should neither be overfitting nor be underfitting .
